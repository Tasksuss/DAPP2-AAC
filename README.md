# DAPP2-AAC
This repository contains all scripts written for the DAPP 2 group 3 who's working the project about Wearable Augmented Alternative Communication (WAAC) Device.
The project's software contains the following modules:
    
    UI Module:
    Text-to-Speech Module:
    Eye-Tracking Module:
    IMU Module:
    Commuincation Module:


The communication module will be the most difficult to code, since developers need to refer to multiple APIs from Google, Rasperries Pi, and others to ensure the smooth communication; The Eye-tracking and IMU will be the second and third hard module because they need to handle input data in its raw form and will need to be programmed in lower-level language; The UI and TTS module are easier and can be written in Python leveraged on the existing packages ready to be installed.
