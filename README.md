# DAPP2-AAC
This repository contains all scripts written for the DAPP 2 group 3 who's working the project about Wearable Augmented Alternative Communication (WAAC) Device.
The project's software contains the following modules:
    
    UI Module: Manages the user interface for text input and selection.
    Text-to-Speech Module: Converts text input into speech output.
    Eye-Tracking Module: Handles eye movement detection and gaze tracking.
    IMU Module: Processes head movement data for additional input commands.
    Commuincation Module: Handles data transfer between the Raspberry Pi and Google Glass.


The communication module will be the most difficult to code, since developers need to refer to multiple APIs from Google, Rasperries Pi, and others to ensure the smooth communication; The Eye-tracking and IMU will be the second and third hard module because they need to handle input data in its raw form and will need to be programmed in lower-level language; The UI and TTS module are easier and can be written in Python leveraged on the existing packages ready to be installed.
