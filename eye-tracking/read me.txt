The eye-tracking with whole face folder is the version that I used in presentation. It is not useful now but it's still a good example if you want to learn some principles of coding to eye-tracking. Now we are workin gon eye-tracking for single eye.

Aims:
We need two output: the relative position of pupil center and the time when eye closed (blinking)


Now we should working on the single eye but there still have some problems to solve:
1. Using calibration to make sure the threshold that of pupil area is suitable for all environment. Because the environment  change will significantly change the degree of light in pupil area, which make the result less accurate.

## I try to add some calibration ways, but it finally decrease the accurancy. 

2. The region that I extract from video is not stable, the size of cropped frame is changing rapidly. It means the relative position of center of pupil might unstable


3. I'm not sure the angle between camera and eye so the way to calculate the position of eye in cropped frame might change to suit the keyboard.

We need to adjust when we collect the raspberry pi and camera (I will test that after first mastery exam with Apollo and Jackson)

4. Convert the code into C++ to increase the speed (optional)
